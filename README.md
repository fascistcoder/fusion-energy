Edison once said “I would put my money on sun, what a source of power” Solar energy is free but still you do not find panels on every rooftop because they are still expensive. Commercial buildings (office buildings, malls, hospitals,) pay average 8-9 rs / unit. Here we come In we at fusion energy offer them cheaper clean electricity by installing solar panels on their rooftops for free.. With our models, our clients save average 20 % on electricity bills without any investments and just pay 4-5 rs/unit for electricity they use. With our grid connected invertor based model, we no longer need to worry about power cuts also. Our vision is to power all buildings in cities using solar.
