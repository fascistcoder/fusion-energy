Edison once said “I would put my money on sun, what a source of power” Solar energy is free but still you do not find panels on every rooftop because they are still expensive. Commercial buildings (office buildings, malls, hospitals,) pay average 8-9 rs / unit. Here we come In we at fusion energy offer them cheaper clean electricity by installing solar panels on their rooftops for free.. With our models, our clients save average 20 % on electricity bills without any investments and just pay 4-5 rs/unit for electricity they use. With our grid connected invertor based model, we no longer need to worry about power cuts also. Our vision is to power all buildings in cities using solar.

IDEA:- Generally commercial buildings (Malls, Hospitals, etc.) have to pay 8-11 Rs per
unit electricity and during peak hours it’s 11

Our vision is to gather capital to install solar panels on these rooftops and sell
them electricity for 6-7 Rs per unit.

According to general estimates 30 kW modules can be deployed on such location
which cost around Rs.12.6 laksh

This panels generate 46500 units electricity every year

Solar panels work for 25 years with a degeneration of 20% over this period.

Plan:- We plan to get 70 % of 12.6 lakhs from bank at 10% interest rate and rest 30%
from investors (3.78 lakhs).

This tenure of loan would be of 10 years. Quarterly payment of Rs 35,146

Profits will start form very 1st year of Rs 1.72 lakhs and will amount up to Rs
35.38 lakhs at the end of 25th year account degeneration

Thus equity IRR of this project will be 44% ROI
8.36 and a payback period of 1.5 years.

Project IRR of 11% ROI 1.8 Payback Period of 10
years.

Assuming we sell power at 6 Rs/Unit (Conservative)

Vision

Our Goal is to cover every commercial building with solar rooftop to benefit
users, investors and more importantly the society by producing electricity from a
renewable never-ending source our sun. Every unit of electricity prevents 0.7 kg
(360 liters) of green house gases. Thus our single installation will prevent 736.43
metric tons of CO2 from going into atmosphere.
